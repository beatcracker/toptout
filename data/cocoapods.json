  "description": "First up, we don't want to know anything about your app. So in order to know unique targets we use your project's target UUID as an identifier. These are a hash of your MAC address, Xcode's process id and the time of target creation (but we only know the UUID/hash, so your MAC address is unknown to us). These UUIDs never change in a project's lifetime (contrary to, for example, the bundle identifier). We double hash it just to be super safe.",
